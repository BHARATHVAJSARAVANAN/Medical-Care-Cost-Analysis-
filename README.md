Link for dataset : https://github.com/BHARATHVAJSARAVANAN/Medical-Care-Cost-Analysis-/blob/cd2eff644ea82c4810495a17f04919a5b339e34b/insurance%20dataset.csv

2. Create an IBM account and get accesss to IBM Cognos Analytics and IBM Cloud.

3. Link IBM Cognos analytics and IBM Cloud

4. Upload the Medical Dataset
   
5. Create Dasboard, Story and Result for the Medical care cost 

6. Create a Website using HTML, CSS, Javascipt and Integrated with Dashboard, Story and Report.

7. The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.

8. Then a SVR model was built on top of it which had 0.88 R2_score.
